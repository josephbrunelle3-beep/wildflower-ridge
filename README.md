# Wildflower Ridge

*Live your life. Ride your dreams.*

A cosy horse-ranch life sim for the browser, built with Phaser 3, TypeScript and Vite.
This is the vertical slice: one ranch map, a horse to care for and ride, a day/night clock,
a townsperson to meet, two starter quests, and local saves.

## Play

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| WASD / arrows | Walk (or ride) |
| Shift | Run / gallop |
| E | Interact, talk, mount menu, dismount |
| 1-8 | Select a tool on the hotbar |
| Esc | Pause menu (save, quit) |

Get Star's trust up by petting and feeding her, select the saddle (7) to tack up, then choose
Ride from her care menu. Sleep in the house after 6 PM to end the day; the game autosaves.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Typecheck and production build to `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build |
| `npm test` | Unit tests for the pure systems (Vitest) |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |

Append `?st=1` to the URL to run the game loop on timers instead of requestAnimationFrame
(keeps it ticking in a hidden tab; handy for automated testing).

## Layout

```
src/main.ts              Phaser config and boot
src/config/              keys, tile catalogue, balance tunables
src/state/GameState.ts   the single serialisable save state
src/core/                EventBus (scene <-> HUD messaging), Session (live state)
src/systems/             Phaser-free logic: time, horse care, quests, saves, economy, interaction
src/entities/            Player, Horse, Npc sprites
src/scenes/              Boot, Title, Ranch (world), UI (HUD overlay)
src/ui/                  panels, hotbar, minimap, care menu, dialogue, pause, toasts
src/gfx/                 placeholder art and the ranch map, both generated at boot
src/data/                quests, items, dialogue JSON
tests/                   Vitest specs for the systems
```

## Swapping in real art

`src/gfx/PlaceholderTextures.ts` documents the frame layout of every generated sheet. Load a
real sheet under the same texture key in `BootScene.preload` and the placeholder for that key
is skipped. Tile order for the tileset is in `src/config/tiles.ts`. See `CREDITS.md` for the
packs planned and their licences.
